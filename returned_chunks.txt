boolean Java has a primitive type, called , for logical values. It can have only one of two true false possible values, or . This is the type returned by all relational operators, as in the a < b boolean case of . is also the type required by the conditional expressions that govern the if for control statements such as and . boolean Here is a program that demonstrates the type: // Demonstrate boolean values

. boolean Here is a program that demonstrates the type: // Demonstrate boolean values. class BoolTest { public static void main(String args[]) { boolean b; b = false; System.out.println("b is " + b); b = true; System.out.println("b is " + b); // a boolean value can control the if statement if(b) System.out.println("This is executed."); b = false;

boolean Boolean literals are simple. There are only two logical values that a value can have, true false true false and . The values of and do not convert into any numerical representation. true false The literal in Java does not equal 1, nor does the literal equal 0. In Java, the boolean Boolean literals can only be assigned to variables declared as or used in expressions with Boolean operators.
