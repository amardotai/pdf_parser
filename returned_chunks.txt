#### Table 3-1
Character Escape Sequences Character Escape Sequences "Hello World" "two\nlines" "â€‰\"This is in quotes\"" The escape sequences and octal/hexadecimal notations that were defined for character literals work the same way inside of string literals. One important thing to note about Java strings is that they must begin and end on the same line. There is no line-continuation escape sequence as there is in some other languages.
